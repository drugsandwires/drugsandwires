<p>Blue Pill Arcade, Drugs &amp; Wires prequel comic, is now finished!</p>

<p>BPA takes us back to the year 1993 and explores Dan and Eve’s relationship and the early days of VR in Stradania.</p>

<p>You don’t need to read D&amp;W or the original Dreamspace prequel as BPA is meant to be completely standalone.</p>

<p>Not many people know that, but our boy Dan used to make music in his university days. Thanks to the wonders of technology his <a href="https://danielanonyme.bandcamp.com/album/privation-sensorielle">1992 debut</a> “Privation Sensorielle” has been digitised and preserved for generations to come, possibly against its creator’s will.</p>

<p>(pic unrelated! But I really don’t post enough non-comic art here!)</p>

<p>Happy (belated!) 2019, everyone. Cryo here! (or..Mary, seeing how I’ve totally deanonymised myself on social media lately.</p>

<p>I realised this website’s been quiet for a while now so I figured I’d give you an update of all the things in case you don’t follow our ramblings on social media.</p>

<p>Drugs &amp; Wires has been updating on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires">Patreon</a> for the past few weeks - I felt like it’s best to build a buffer for public updates going forward. The good news is that public updates will resume this Wednesday, 23rd Jan - but if you just can’t wait you can read the first 3 pages on Patreon for just $3. I’ve also had to switch my streams to patreon-only to avoid spoilers, those are available to all patrons!</p>

<p>We still have an active <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/paN3Wu5">Discord </a>with open access and a welcoming community for all as well as an exclusive #patreon channel where I post WIPs for patrons and other things sometimes. (if you scroll far enough you might even find some extremely secret pre-2012 art of what would eventually become Dan and Lin)</p>

<p>All physical Kickstarter rewards went out back in October 2018, and digital goodies dropped in November. Please get in touch if you’re a backer and haven’t received your package so we can sort something out! So far we’ve only had a couple of packages returning or missing. KS fulfillment was a ton of work for us both, but seeing the items drop was so satisfying. Thanks to all of you who supported the campaign! &lt;3 I don’t think I ever want to burn another floppy, though.</p>

<p>If you missed the Kickstarter and would like to buy the book, it’s available in<a href="https://www.hellovoid.online/"> my new store</a>!  I’ve also got some other merch available too, though most Kickstarter stuff is very limited edition and as I’m typing this there’s only 2 Wirehead shirts left.</p>

<p>Regarding convention appearances: I managed to get a trading table at<a href="https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/dublin-comic-con-2019-spring-edition-tickets-50038407223"> Dublin Comic Con </a>this March! Nothing else confirmed so far. Now that I live in Ireland travelling for UK cons is gonna be a bit more of a challenge!</p>

<p>Lastly I wanted to apologise for the mess that 2018 was for updates, it’s all on me. I went back to full time work last year and between that, Kickstarter prep and a cross country move it’s been hard to keep my schedule and brain stable! Thankfully things are looking better now - for the time being I’m back on freelance so I’ve been doing colouring for <a href="https://twitter.com/Casparnova/status/1062770944102592513">Peter Cannon: Thunderbolt</a> with the <a href="https://twitter.com/Casparnova">best</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kierongillen">team</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HassanOE">ever</a>, getting my new merch brand Hello Void off the ground (I liked designing KS merch so much I decided I don’t want to stop) and also trying to get Drugs &amp; Wires back on track.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for reading and sticking with us! Here’s to many more pages in 2019.</p>

<p>After months of prep and numbercrunch, the <em>Drugs &amp; Wires Volume 1</em> Kickstarter is now <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kickstarter.com%2Fprojects%2Fcryoclaire%2Fdrugs-and-wires-down-in-a-hole&amp;t=YTA0YTRiNmYyNjAwZTM5YjEzNWQ5OWFlNGI2ZDIyMjExNTcyMzliZixGZnlQcmZVdA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ABbtoBJK_ClHVqlkSkAYQPQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcryoclaire.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F175580424779%2Fblackiochronicles-after-months-of-prep-and">officially live!</a></p>

<p>Help us fund the first collected edition of <em>D&amp;W</em> and score some fun (and exclusive!) goodies while doing so - a win-win for everybody!</p>

<p>Hey everyone! Cryo here with a very much belated news update. We really don’t update this thing often enough.</p>

<p>If you’re reading Drugs &amp; Wires regularly, you might have noticed that our updates have been a bit all over the place lately - and I apologise for that! A couple of months ago I had to go back to working full-time  and readjusting to that has been challenging. In addition to that, I’m busy preparing the first issue of Blue Pill Arcade for London MCM and both me and Io are working on some extras and things for our upcoming Kickstarter! (more on that later)</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems like June is going to be extremely busy for both work and personal reasons, so** unfortunately I’m left with no other choice than to take a mini-hiatus and put D&amp;W on a break until July**. We might update before then, but I can’t promise it’ll be regular. I’m very sorry about that - hopefully the stuff we’ll be working on in the meantime is gonna make up for that! I’ve also closed down our Tictail store until after MCM to help me keep track of stock.</p>

<p>Speaking of Kickstarters - we’re planning on launching one for a collected edition of chapters 1-4. I’ve been slowly adapting it all for print and making rewards (BPA comic being one of them) and there’s still a lot of work to be done, but hopefully we’ll get there! If you’d like to know when it launches, <a href="https://forms.omnisrc.com/signup/v1/5aef8996597ed76bb7ba32f7_5aef8a0d597ed74e366b4ba4.html">sign up for our mailing list here</a>. (Your email might already be on there if you’ve bought stuff from the Tictail store in the past) I promise I won’t spam you more than a couple times a year - it’s just a neat option for people who can’t keep up with my shitposting on social media!</p>

<p>I’ll be documenting everything we do on the meantime on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires">Patreon</a> and Patreon-only Discord channel and hopefully giving people early glimpses of the pages when I do get to draw them.</p>

<p>And finally, here’s a regular reminder that D&amp;W does have its own very active &amp; friendly <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/paN3Wu5">Discord server </a>- so do have a look if you haven’t yet.</p>

<h3 id="blue-pill-arcade---side-comic-launch"><a href="/news/side-comic-launch.html">Blue Pill Arcade - Side Comic Launch</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/news/" alt="ohnoooo1" /></p>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>

<p>Good news - after many months of writing scripts and thumbnails, Blue Pill Arcade is finally getting drawn! First 5 pages are already up on<a href="https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires"> Patreon</a>.</p>

<p>Blue Pill Arcade is a prequel set 2 years before the events of the main comic. While <a href="https://dreamspace.nfshost.com/">Dreamspace </a>(our original prequel series) focuses on Dan’s last moments in VR, BPA is all about the early days of Dreamspace and its users. Expect it to be a little more light-hearted than the main series (light-hearted by D&amp;W standards, anyway…)</p>

<p>We’ll update the comic  in monthly installments of 6 to 8 pages (depending on Cryo’s workload) and keep it as a Patreon exclusive until the story is finished.  Once it’s done, we’ll see how to go about publishing it, but it’d most likely be available for purchase online.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s a sneak peak of people’s typical reaction to Fixer:</p>

<h3 id="drugs--wires-3--convention-schedule"><a href="/news/convention-schedule.html">Drugs &amp; Wires #3 &amp; Convention Schedule</a></h3>

<p>Hey everyone, haven’t posted here in a while! Actually, I’m pretty sure this is my first time writing a news post on here - normally Io’s much better at it, but I’ve got way more free time on my hands these days, so it’s only fair I start updating more often.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/news/" alt="chapter3coverfinal2" /></p>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>

<p>So, the big news: Issue #3, “Rock Bottom” is ready to be sent off to the printers - we’re currently taking pre-orders to help us with the printing costs! You can order a copy (and limited edition sketch) in <a href="https://drugsandwires.tictail.com/product/drugs-wires-3-pre-orders">D&amp;W Tictail store</a>. For those of you supporting us on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires">Patreon</a>, you can grab a 20% discount code in the latest post.</p>

<p>If you’d rather pick it up from Cryoclaire in person, here’s a list of our convention appearances confirmed so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Em-con, Nottingham, 29-30th April</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TCAF, Toronto,  13-14th May (First time in Canada! Exciting times)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MCM London 26-29th May</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thought Bubble, Leeds, 23-24th September</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nottingham Comic Con, Nottingham, 14th October.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hope to see some of you there!</p>

<p>If you’re ever in Nottingham but can’t make it to the conventions, Drugs &amp; Wires is now stocked at thte Page45 comic shop - they even said some nice things about us <a href="https//www.page45.com/store/Drugs-Wires-1.html">in their review</a>!</p>

<p>We  got some very positive and in-depth review from <a href="http://loser-city.com/features/drugs-wires-is-a-clever-and-flashy-cyberpunk-alt-history">Loser-City</a> and got to be a Pick Of The Week over at <a href="https://comicbookhour.com/threads/first-ever-pick-of-the-week.354/#post-2936">ComicBookHour</a> all in the past couple of weeks.</p>

<p>And since I’m just showing off now, we also <a href="https://comicsalliance.com/cryoclaire-io-black-drugs-and-wires-interview/">got interviewed</a> by Jon Erik Christianson over at Comics Alliance which was great. Sadly we’ve heard sad news of the website getting shut down - so go read the thing while it’s still available! There are many more interviews with indie/webcomic creators including our comic buddies <a href="http://comicsalliance.com/tags/rising-sand/">Rising Sand</a>.</p>

<p>All in all it’s been a good year for D&amp;W so far and we can’t wait to come back with Chapter 4!  And with that I’ll stop typing and go get some actual work done. Eloquent news post is definitely more of Io’s thing.</p>

<p>-Cryo</p>

<h3 id="happy-new-year-again"><a href="/news/new-year.html">Happy New Year (Again!)</a></h3>

<p>And welcome to 2017! For most of us, last year wobbled wildly between “kind of OK” and “five-alarm blaze at the local fireworks factory that’s also somehow an orphanage”, so if we can hope for one thing, it’s that this new year will bring some good news with it, too.</p>

<p>As far as the comic went, however, 2016 actually wasn’t <em>all</em> that shabby:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We celebrated our first anniversary with a big fanart contest, which honestly yielded <a href="http://www.drugsandwires.fail/fanart-contest-winners/">more amazing submissions</a> than it had any right to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>D&amp;W more than doubled its subscriber base on Tapastic, rocketing from around 1,200 followers in January 2016 to comfortably over 3,000 by year’s end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After months of hemming, we finally Did The Thing and launched <a href="https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires">our Patreon</a> with a range of new art and behind-the-scenes commentary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With new translator Alex on board, we rebooted the <a href="http://acomics.ru/~drugsandwires">Russian-language version of D&amp;W</a> with a vengeance and finally caught up to the English comic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also picked up a bit of additional coverage, with mentions on <a href="http://reversemeltdown.com/2016/11/22/webcomic-spotlight-drugs-and-wires/">ReverseMeltdown</a>, <a href="http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/4879312/tdest_id/165185">Canned Air</a>, <a href="http://prettycoolwebcomics.tumblr.com/post/138266003492/pretty-cool-webcomics-drugs-and-wires">Pretty Cool Webcomics</a>, and <a href="http://awesomecomics.podbean.com/e/episode-32-knowledge-is-power-a-comic-book-q-a/?token=17ebc44c6d4b51a3d42ed086d41bb96f">The Awesome Comics Podcast</a>, as well as an in-depth interview with Tom Mortimer over at <a href="http://dirtyrottencomics.co.uk/?p=1876">Dirty Rotten Comics</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On top of that, D&amp;W was recognized for Excellence in Writing and Science Fiction by the folks at <a href="http://startfaire.com/home.shtml">StArt Faire</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>D&amp;W was present at almost every major comic con in the UK last year, but one event was particularly special: our first combined showing at the <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/">Thought Bubble Festival</a> in Leeds, which mostly proved I can’t maintain a consistent signature for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And elsewhere, Dan clocked in cameo appearances in <a href="https://tapastic.com/episode/202901">HeLL(P)</a> and <a href="http://risingsand.glass/page/6">Rising Sand</a>, plus a very special guest slot in the most recent episode of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/377970/">Void &amp; Meddler</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All this, of course, wouldn’t be possible without our readers and supporters, so wherever you may be: thank you, and all the best for the year ahead. We’re glad to have you with us.</p>

<p>- Io</p>

<p>That’s right: it’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires">official</a>. If you follow us on social media, you’ll probably know that we’ve been toying with the idea of setting up a Patreon for quite a while now - all the cool webcomics artists are doing it, so why not us? But we always hit a <em>bit</em> of a hurdle when it came to content: we’re not quite in a position where we can offer things like more frequent comic updates, but still want to give people something substantial for their support.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of weeks, though, we’ve finally had the time to put together a little grab bag of fan goodies: comics, production art, original script pages, and behind-the-scenes insights. It’s a list that’ll probably expand a bit in the months ahead; it’s important to us that backers get a proper bang-for-buck ratio, and we’re kinda figuring out this whole Patreon lark as we go along. So if you’ve got a suggestion about how we can improve our offerings, let us know! Our metaphorical door is always open.</p>

<p>As for <em>D&amp;W</em> itself, you’ll be happy to know that our summer hiatus is almost over - in fact, the cover for Chapter 3 is being sketched out as we speak. Watch this space…</p>

<p>In other non-comic news, <em>D&amp;W</em> friend/occasional collaborator/unstoppable music factory Neon Shudder released his first full-length LP, <a href="http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/cadence"><em>Cadence</em></a>, on Bandcamp earlier this month. This cyberpunk concept album-slash-multimedia experiment builds on last year’s <a href="http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/o-8015">O​-​8015 EP</a> with 20 fresh tracks, and includes an illustrated digital novella authored by Mr. Shudder himself.</p>

<p>Longtime followers will discover that <em>Cadence</em> marks a big artistic push forward for Yung Shud - a release that doesn’t just play with presentation and storytelling, but also offers a broader palette of sounds than previous Neon Shudder EPs.</p>

    <p><strong>Dreamspace: Analogue Edition</strong> - Ever since the initial run of <em>Dreamspace: Analogue Edition</em> sold out, we’ve been peppered with requests for a reprint, so here it is. We took the opportunities to make some tweaks to the story and clean up the continuity a touch; consider this <em>Analogue Edition 1.01</em>. Fair warning, though: this’ll probably be the last time we make <em>AE</em> available to the general public, so get your copy while the going’s good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Drugs &amp; Wires: Issue 2</strong> - Fresh off the presses, it’s the entirely of <em>D.D.F.H.</em> in future-proof dead-tree format, complete with highly collectible variant cover! (Hey, it’s the ’90s.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>D&amp;W Temporary Tattoos</strong> - If you follow Cryoclaire on social media, chances are you’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242/status/733270917741182976">already seen these</a>, but we’re still very, very excited about them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll also be selling <em>D&amp;W: Issue 1</em>, the <em>Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie</em> one-shot collection, prints, postcards, buttons, and more, more, more. Look for Claire at Table CL2, conveniently located within a stone’s throw of the Kids Zone, a decision the organizers may yet regret. (And if you can’t make it to London, just watch this space - we’ll be updating our store shortly after the event!)</p>

<p>We had a fantastic selection of entries for our first anniversary fanart contest - more, honestly, than either of us were expecting. But after a lot of soul-searching and some valuable input from our significant others and cyber-pals, we finally picked our four lucky winners!</p>

<p>You can find full-size version of these images (and all of the other great submissions!) on our <a href="https://www.drugsandwires.fail/art/">fanart page</a>. A big “thank you” to everybody who participated!</p>

<h3 id="one-year-of-drugs--wires"><a href="/news/one-year.html">One Year of Drugs &amp; Wires!</a></h3>

<p>Yep, it’s true. On March 22nd, 2015, we officially launched this wild, weird little enterprise into the World Wide Web, making this our first official anniversary.</p>

<p>The last 12 months have been a bit of a blur, but in the best way possible: we’ve published 44 pages of comics, met a lot of talented creators in the process, and - best of all - discovered that there’s actually a surprisingly substantial audience for our cyberpunk-flavored brand of post-Soviet misery. So to all our comment section regulars, Tapastic subscribers, and everyone who’s read, purchased, shared, reviewed our comic, and visited us at conventions… Thank you for making this happen!</p>

<p>We’ll be posting the results of our <a href="http://www.drugsandwires.fail/drugs-wires-anniversary-contest/">fanart contest</a> on the 24th once we’ve had a chance to go over all of the entries - harder than it sounds, since we’ve been literally snowed in with great stuff these past couple of weeks! In the meantime, you might also be interested in this little <a href="http://www.drugsandwires.fail/drugs-wires-anniversary-contest/">behind-the-scenes look at the comic’s production</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve been experimenting with art livestreams since the earliest days of the comic, and after a couple of venue and scheduling changes, we’ve finally settled into a new home and time slot. You can now watch Cryoclaire assemble new pages on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/cryoclaire">Twitch</a> Saturdays and Sundays - exact start times are announced on her <a href="https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. Our streams usually run for a few hours; art aside, you’ll get a chance to chat with other fans and creators, sample Claire’s industrial/witchhouse/vaporwave playlists, and take in a sterling selection of random crap we’ve unearthed on YouTube.</p>

<p>_D&amp;W _also recently gained its very own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/drugsandwires">subreddit</a> on reddit.com, so if you’ve got an account and are looking for an all-new venue to chat about everybody’s favorite depressed-Slav-in-cyberpunk-‘90s-hell webseries, swing on by!</p>

<p>Our buddy Signalrun (AKA Neon Shudder) has had a busy couple of months: following an appropriately spooky (or indeed, spoopy)<a href="http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/o-8015"> Halloween release</a> and several previews from his first full-length album, he’s ringing in 2016 with an all-new EP, entitled <a href="http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/viii-neuromantic-the-communion-of-nature-and-technology">(viii) neuromantic: the communion of nature and technology</a>. This pay-what-you-want release features four tracks of synth-driven atmospherics, including a collaboration with fellow PA-based (x)-wavers Reapers.</p>

<p>Neon Shudder is also a featured artist on the latest <a href="http://cyberpunkcommunitysoundtrack.tumblr.com/post/137943275310/cyberpunk-community-soundtrack-no5-2015-free">Cyberpunk Community Soundtrack</a>, a 100% free compilation of music inspired by everybody’s favorite chromed-up sci-fi genre.

<p><img src="/assets/img/news/" alt="Dreamspace Analogue Edition" /></p>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>

<p>History time: way back in 2013, Cryoclaire launched <em>Dreamspace</em>, an animated, pseudo-interactive story about a down-on-his-luck VR mindtripper named Dan and his (mostly) gradual descent into addiction. In 2014, <em>Dreamspace _was collected into a print edition with revised dialogue and some additional material, appropriately called _Dreamspace: Analogue Edition</em>. Last year, the first print run of _Analogue Edition _officially sold out, and we started planning an expanded second edition to replace it. As of January 2016, we’re… still in the planning stages, to be honest, so while _Analogue Edition 2.0 _sits in creative limbo, we thought we’d at least make the original available online.</p>

<p>Like all things <em>D&amp;W</em>, you can access (and subscribe to!) the suddenly less appropriately titled _DS: Analogue Edition _through <a href="http://tapastic.com/cryoclaire">Cryoclaire’s Tapastic page</a>.</p>

<p>The 2015 con season is almost at an end, but we’ve got one more show to close out the year. Next weekend, Claire will be joining a who’s who of comics talent at <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/">Thought Bubble</a>, the Leeds Comic Art Festival. Going to TB? You can check us out at <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/tb-marquee-floor-plan/">table 91</a> in the TB Marquee exhibit area from November 14th to 15th. Due to the limited space (we’re restricted to a half table), the merch selection will be a little more selective than at MCM London, but there’ll be plenty of copies of both <em>Drugs and Wires #1</em> and the new third printing of <em>Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie!</em></p>

<h3 id="comic-con-is-a-wrap"><a href="/news/comiccon-wrap.html">Comic Con is a Wrap!</a></h3>

<p>Another fall, another MCM expo in the bag! <a href="http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london">MCM London Comic Con</a> is usually the highlight of the _D&amp;W _events calendar, and this one was no exception: we met some great fans (and hopefully made a few new ones!), got a lot of fun sketch requests, and best of all, sold every single comic we came with. Thanks to everybody who stopped by over the weekend!</p>

<h3 id="drugs--wires-issue-1-coming-to-print"><a href="/news/issue-1.html">Drugs &amp; Wires Issue 1 Coming to Print!</a></h3>

<p><em>Drugs &amp; Wires _is currently on hiatus, but Team D&amp;W is far from idle! With the fall/winter con season now in full gear, we’re plugging away at a couple of new print projects that we’re hoping to debut at the <a href="http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london">London MCM Comic Con</a> and <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/">Thought Bubble</a>. First on the docket: the print version of _Drugs &amp; Wires _Chapter 1. “Clean and Sober Living” collects all 23 pages of the webcomic to date, along with selections of Cryoclaire’s concept art and one of our all-time most popular _D&amp;W _one-shots, <a href="http://tapastic.com/episode/143666">“The Arm”</a>. To tie it all together, Claire’s whipped up an all-new, extra-moody coloring job for the title page. That’s right: we’re talking _variant cover</em>. Can’t get much more ’90s than that.</p>

<p>But if you can’t make it to London or Leeds, don’t worry - we’ll be offering _D&amp;W: Clean and Sober Living _through our online store as soon as we shake off the convention dust, along with any other new print merch we manage to crank out these next few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="news-roundup-russian-edition-comic-chameleon-tv-tropes"><a href="/news/news-roundup.html">News Roundup: Russian Edition, Comic Chameleon, TV Tropes!</a></h3>

<p>It’s been a busy couple of weeks behind the scenes!</p>

<p>What’s new? For starters, we’ve launched <a href="http://acomics.ru/~drugsandwires/1">a Russian-language version of</a> <em>Drugs and Wires</em> through webcomics portal Авторский Комикс (“Comic Authors”). Localization comes courtesy of Claire and the talented <a href="http://loveisliquid.tumblr.com/">loveisliquid</a>, with new pages being added as time permits. If you’re one of our Tapastic followers, you’ll eventually be able to access those translations via <a href="http://tapastic.com/episode/116129">D&amp;W’s Tapastic page</a>, too.</p>

<p>We also recently submitted <em>D&amp;W</em> to the <a href="http://www.comicchameleon.com">Comic Chameleon</a> iPhone app. Comic Chameleon hosts over 130 webcomics in an easy-to-browse, mobile-friendly format with full creator support, and their line-up includes some of the biggest titles out there (in addition to a lot of cool up-and-comers). New comics are added based on reader interest, so, if you’d like to see Dan and company make an appearance on CC, please take a minute to <a href="http://www.comicchameleon.com/request">drop a request to the app’s creators</a>.</p>

<p>And last (but not least), <em>Drugs &amp; Wires</em> now has its own <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DrugsAndWires">TV Tropes page!</a> Fans have already started adding some great material, and we’re looking forward to seeing how things evolve as the story progresses.</p>

<h3 id="new-neon-shudder-ep-now-available"><a href="/news/new-neon-shudder.html">New Neon Shudder EP Now Available!</a></h3>

<p>Cyberpunk composer (and Cryoclaire collaborator) Neon Shudder just dropped his latest EP, <em>Ghost Process</em>, on <a href="https://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-process" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>. Coming hot on the heels of March’s <em><a href="http://www.drugsandwires.fail/hex-phase-ep-released/" target="_blank">Hex Phase</a></em>, this 6-track release is a pay-what-you-want purchase, and includes a remix of “Xenostasis”, a song originally composed as background music for our <a href="http://dreamspace.nfshost.com/ds3/ds3.html" target="_blank">Dreamspace 3.03</a> motion comic. <i>Ghost Process </i>is also included in the upcoming <em><a href="https://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/merch/collective-20" target="_blank">Collective 2.0</a></em>, a limited-edition compilation of the first six Neon Shudder EPs in MP3 CD format.</p>

<p>Neon Shudder <a href="http://signalrun.tumblr.com/post/122513626078/a-year-ago-i-made-post-saying-i-was-beginning-work" target="_blank">recently announced</a> plans for his first full-length release, the concept album <em>Cadence.</em></p>

<h3 id="drugs--wires-livestream-moves-to-wednesdays"><a href="/news/livestream-wednesdays.html">Drugs &amp; Wires Livestream Moves to Wednesdays!</a></h3>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, we started streaming Claire’s inking and coloring for <em>D&amp;W</em> on <a href="https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel.php?watch=cryoclaire">Picarto</a>. Despite a few hiccups, we’ve managed to attract a lively community of readers and fellow creators, and kicked off plenty of fun discussions in the process.</p>

<p>Going forward, we’re moving our “regular” livestream to Wednesdays at 8 PM BST/7 PM GMT, with the occasional Saturday livestream thrown in when scheduling allows. This gives Claire more time to prep the page, and will hopefully make the stream a little more interesting in the process.</p>

<p>As before, streams will be announced on Claire’s <a href="http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242">Twitter</a> accounts about an hour or so before they kick off. Most streams usually feature both of us, so it’s your chance to chat with the D&amp;W team, get some insights into our creative process, and ask those burning (spoiler-free) questions.</p>

<h3 id="dw-one-shots-now-available-on-tapastic"><a href="/news/one-shots.html">D&amp;W One-Shots Now Available on Tapastic!</a></h3>

<p>While <em>D&amp;W</em> “officially” launched in 2015, Dan and Lin first started appearing in short comics and one-panel strips way back in early 2013. Together with <a href="http://dreamspace.nfshost.com/">Dreamspace</a>, these one-shots established the look and feel of Dan’s world, and ultimately formed the basis of the webcomic you see today.</p>

<p>Until recently, getting to these older comics meant wading through Cryoclaire’s Tumblr or DeviantArt account. No more, though: the new <em>Drugs &amp; Wires: Oneshots</em> collection on Tapastic pulls together the best (or at least, most coherent) of Dan and Lin’s vintage misadventures in <a href="http://tapastic.com/series/DW-Oneshots">one easy-to-browse location</a>. As an added bonus, subscribers will automatically be notified when future one-shots are published. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="mcm-london-comic-con-wrap-up"><a href="/news/london-comiccon.html">MCM London Comic Con Wrap-Up!</a></h3>

<p>A big and hearty “thank you” to everybody who came out to see Cryoclaire and Will - our Head of Keen and D&amp;W Hypeman-at-Large - at MCM last weekend! We sold plenty of stuff (including the very last copies of <em>Dreamspace: Analogue Edition</em> and the first of our all-new <a href="http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/post/119796535649/so-heres-some-of-the-commissions-ive-done-this">Cyborg Trash sketch commissions</a>) and met some wonderful fans and creators along the way. But if you didn’t get a chance to stop by, never fear: we’re hoping to be back in town come <a href="http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/">October</a>.</p>

<p>Still need more Dan in your life? Besides our usual range of buttons, prints and postcards, you can also snag a copy of <a href="http://cryoclaire.bigcartel.com/product/drugs-wires-daily-struggles-of-a-cyberjunkie"><em>Drugs &amp; Wires: Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie</em>,</a> a grab-bag of <em>D&amp;W</em> one-shots originally published on Claire’s Tumblr between 2012 to 2014. Comic Con will also be one of the last times you can get your hands on the <em>D&amp;W</em> prequel <a href="http://cryoclaire.bigcartel.com/product/dreamspace-analogue-edition"><em>Dreamspace: Analog Edition</em></a>, at least for the foreseeable future. As of the time of writing, there’s less than 20 copies left from the initial print run, and we’re still mulling whether to do a reprint once those run out.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s sketch commissions, where just £5 gets you a Cryoclaire original to take home. All said, there’s plenty to see, do, and buy, so be there!</p>

<p>Or, you know, don’t be. We’re not the boss of you.</p>

<h3 id="catch-dw-streaming-on-picarto-tuesdays-and-saturdays"><a href="/news/catch-streaming.html">Catch D&amp;W Streaming on Picarto Tuesdays and Saturdays!</a></h3>

<p>Since nothing boosts your productivity quite like dozens of strangers staring over your e-shoulder, Cryoclaire recently started streaming her penciling and inking sessions on <a href="https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel.php?watch=cryoclaire">Picarto.tv</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to take a peek behind the scenes at <em>D&amp;W</em> - or just need an excuse to shoot the breeze about vital, vital topics like Skyler White and the <em>Leprechaun</em> franchise over some bangin’ witch house - future streaming dates and times will be announced via Claire’s <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cryoclaire242">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: We finally have a schedule of sorts!</strong> Tuesdays and Saturdays. 8pm BST (London time) We’re usually on for 3-4 hours. Hope this helps!</p>

<h3 id="join-cryoclaire-at-the-leeds-thought-bubble-expo"><a href="/news/join-cryoclaire-at-thought-bubble.html">Join Cryoclaire at the Leeds Thought Bubble Expo!</a></h3>

<p>If you’re a UK resident and serious about comics, Leeds’ Thought Bubble Festival is a fantastic place to meet some of the most talented creators in the field. _(Seriously, just look at <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/guests/">this lineup</a>.) So naturally, we’re all kinds of hyped that we made the cut for the 2015 <a href="http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/exhibitors/">Thought Bubble Convention</a>, which takes place alongside the Festival on November 14th and 15th.</p>

<p>Cryoclaire will be spreading the <em>D&amp;W</em> gospel to the unsuspecting masses (and hopefully offering some neat new merch to boot), so if you’re making the trip to Thought Bubble this year, stop on by and say ‘hi!’</p>

<h3 id="great-lin-cosplay-by-nix"><a href="/news/great-lin-cosplay.html">Great Lin Cosplay by Nix!</a></h3>

<p>Though her knowledge of the human body is shaky at best and her medical ethics went out the window a long time ago, Lin the modder somehow still finds customers willing to drop good money for her services. Casually indifferent to other humans, she’s developed a bit of a soft spot for Dan over the years - much as you would for a puppy that can’t seem to stop tripping over its own tail.</p>

<p>While we’re still a few weeks out from Lin’s first official appearance in <em>Drugs &amp; Wires</em>, this rendition by reader Nix is almost as good as the real thing (and hopefully, less likely to ‘accidentally’ leave you with <em>massively</em> illegal enhancements <a href="http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/post/78051256811/lin-has-a-mild-crush-on-dan-not-in-the-sense-of">you never asked for</a>).</p>

<p>Even more exciting is the fact that this is our first official fan cosplay -  but hopefully not the last! You can check out <a href="http://partygirl-nix.tumblr.com/post/114883262280/just-dont-fuck-yourself-up-okay-lin-cosplay">Nix’s Tumblr</a> (NSFW) for more pictures of her costume.</p>

<h3 id="hex-phase-ep-released"><a href="/news/hex-phase-ep-released.html">Hex Phase EP Released!</a></h3>

<p>Composer <a href="https://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/">Neon Shudder</a> has been a long-time fixture in Dan and Lin’s messed-up world, having contributed backing tracks to both the second and third installments of <em><a href="http://dreamspace.nfshost.com/">Dreamspace</a></em>. His latest EP, <em>Hex Phase</em>, is now available for streaming and pay-what-you-want download on Bandcamp, and features some pixel-tastic cover art from our very own Cryoclaire! If you’re in the mood for some old-school, synth-driven ambience with a distinct cyberpunk flavor, definitely <a href="https://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/hex-phase">give <em>Hex Phase</em> a spin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="meet-cryoclaire-at-the-mcm-london-comic-con"><a href="/news/meet-cryoclaire.html">Meet Cryoclaire at the MCM London Comic Con!</a></h3>
