<h2 id="what-is-drugs-and-wires">What is Drugs and Wires?</h2>

<p><strong>The year is 1995.</strong></p>

<p>Grunge and alt-rock dominate the airwaves. Floppy disks are still the storage medium of choice. The mainstream media can’t shut up about this amazing new thing called the “Information Superhighway.” And in the shadows of glittering megacities, a loose alliance of cyber-anarchists, techno-pagans, and razorgirls is waging covert war against power-hungry corporations, sinister governments, and injustice and corruption in all of its forms.</p>

<p><strong>This is not their story.</strong></p>

<p>No, this is the story of Dan, pissy misanthrope and recovering VR junkie, now condemned to a dead-end job delivering sketchy packages in a post-Soviet urban hellhole.</p>

<p>This is the story of Lin, a cybernetics installer who treats concepts like “anesthesia” and “disinfectant” as annoying inconveniences, and likes to soundtrack life-altering surgeries with Cannibal Corpse.</p>

<p>And above all, this is the story of what happens when the future that never was meets the past that we occasionally poke fun at on VH1. Welcome to Drugs and Wires.</p>

<h2 id="no-seriously-what-is-drugs-and-wires">No, seriously, what is Drugs and Wires?</h2>

<p>Drugs and Wires is a (hopefully) ongoing webcomic created by Mary Safro aka Cryo (original premise, art, writing, drug research) and Io Black (writing, editing, plot development). It doubles up as a sequel to Dreamspace, a trilogy of motion comics published between 2013 and 2014.</p>

<h2 id="so-do-i-have-to-have-read-dreamspace-to-understand-this-comic">So, do I have to have read Dreamspace to understand this comic?</h2>

<p>Nope. While Drugs and Wires picks up after the conclusion of Dreamspace, it’s ultimately intended to stand on its own. But if you haven’t read Dreamspace yet, why not take a few minutes to check it out? Word of warning: The comic features some flashing animation.</p>

<p>## Hang on. Haven’t there already been Drugs and Wires comics?
Dan and Lin have featured in plenty of short strips and one-panel throwaways over the years, but the Drugs and Wires webcomic takes it to the next level by introducing radical new ideas like ongoing plotlines, character development, a coherent setting, and a cast that consists of more than two people.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-read-drugs-and-wires">Who should read Drugs and Wires?</h2>

<p>Fans of old-school cyberpunk, over-the-top human misery, dubious ’90s nostalgia, outdated technology, dark humor, and entertainment you don’t have to pay for.</p>

<h2 id="who-shouldnt-read-drugs-and-wires">Who shouldn’t read Drugs and Wires?</h2>

<p>This comic is not recommended to any reader likely to be offended by unapologetic drug use, body horror, questionable medical practices, existential angst, or unflattering portrayals of Slavic banana republics. In other words, proceed at your own risk.</p>

<h2 id="ive-read-drugs-and-wires-and-i-love-it-how-do-i-support-you">I’ve read Drugs and Wires and I love it! How do I support you?</h2>
