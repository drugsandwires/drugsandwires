With [MCM London Comic Con](http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/tickets/) just days away, here's a quick peek at the new, remastered Dan x Death print that'll be available for sale at Cryoclaire's table in the [Comic Village](http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/attractions/comic-village/).

Still need more Dan in your life? Besides our usual range of buttons, prints and postcards, you can also snag a copy of [_Drugs &amp; Wires: Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie_,](http://cryoclaire.bigcartel.com/product/drugs-wires-daily-struggles-of-a-cyberjunkie) a grab-bag of *D&amp;W* one-shots originally published on Claire's Tumblr between 2012 to 2014. Comic Con will also be one of the last times you can get your hands on the _D&amp;W_ prequel [_Dreamspace: Analog Edition_](http://cryoclaire.bigcartel.com/product/dreamspace-analogue-edition), at least for the foreseeable future. As of the time of writing, there's less than 20 copies left from the initial print run, and we're still mulling whether to do a reprint once those run out.

Finally, there's sketch commissions, where just £5 gets you a Cryoclaire original to take home. All said, there's plenty to see, do, and buy, so be there!

Or, you know, don't be. We're not the boss of you.
