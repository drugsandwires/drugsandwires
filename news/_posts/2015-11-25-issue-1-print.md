Just in time for the holidays, we've made [\_Drugs &amp; Wires _Issue #1](http://dnwcomic.storenvy.com/products/15207201-drugs-wires-issue-1) and the third printing(!) of \_[Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie](http://dnwcomic.storenvy.com/products/15207471-drugs-wires-daily-struggles-of-a-cyberjunkie) _available through our all-new [StoreEnvy storefront](http://dnwcomic.storenvy.com/)! Copies of Issue #1 come signed on request, and can be upgraded with one or two of our latest batch of (previously con-exclusive) 38mm badges. As an extra-festive bonus, we're also throwing in a free Christmas card with the first 20 orders we receive.
