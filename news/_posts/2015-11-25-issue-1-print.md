Just in time for the holidays, we've made [\_Drugs &amp; Wires _Issue #1](http://dnwcomic.storenvy.com/products/15207201-drugs-wires-issue-1) and the third printing(!) of \_[Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie](http://dnwcomic.storenvy.com/products/15207471-drugs-wires-daily-struggles-of-a-cyberjunkie) _available through our all-new [StoreEnvy storefront](http://dnwcomic.storenvy.com/)! Copies of Issue #1 come signed on request, and can be upgraded with one or two of our latest batch of (previously con-exclusive) 38mm badges. As an extra-festive bonus, we're also throwing in a free Christmas card with the first 20 orders we receive.

Looking for other *D&amp;W* gifts and stocking stuffers? You can always check out our [shirt](http://dnwmerch.spreadshirt.co.uk/) and [print](http://www.redbubble.com/people/cryoclaire/portfolio) stores, too. Happy shopping!
