It's been a busy couple of weeks behind the scenes!

What's new? For starters, we've launched [a Russian-language version of](http://acomics.ru/~drugsandwires/1) _Drugs and Wires_ through webcomics portal Авторский Комикс ("Comic Authors"). Localization comes courtesy of Claire and the talented [loveisliquid](http://loveisliquid.tumblr.com/), with new pages being added as time permits. If you're one of our Tapastic followers, you'll eventually be able to access those translations via [D&amp;W's Tapastic page](http://tapastic.com/episode/116129), too.

We also recently submitted *D&amp;W* to the [Comic Chameleon](http://www.comicchameleon.com) iPhone app. Comic Chameleon hosts over 130 webcomics in an easy-to-browse, mobile-friendly format with full creator support, and their line-up includes some of the biggest titles out there (in addition to a lot of cool up-and-comers). New comics are added based on reader interest, so, if you'd like to see Dan and company make an appearance on CC, please take a minute to [drop a request to the app's creators](http://www.comicchameleon.com/request).

And last (but not least), _Drugs &amp; Wires_ now has its own [TV Tropes page!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DrugsAndWires) Fans have already started adding some great material, and we're looking forward to seeing how things evolve as the story progresses.
