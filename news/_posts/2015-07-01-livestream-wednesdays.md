A couple of weeks ago, we started streaming Claire's inking and coloring for _D&amp;W_ on [Picarto](https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel.php?watch=cryoclaire). Despite a few hiccups, we've managed to attract a lively community of readers and fellow creators, and kicked off plenty of fun discussions in the process.

Going forward, we're moving our "regular" livestream to Wednesdays at 8 PM BST/7 PM GMT, with the occasional Saturday livestream thrown in when scheduling allows. This gives Claire more time to prep the page, and will hopefully make the stream a little more interesting in the process.

As before, streams will be announced on Claire's [Tumblr](http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242) accounts about an hour or so before they kick off. Most streams usually feature both of us, so it's your chance to chat with the D&amp;W team, get some insights into our creative process, and ask those burning (spoiler-free) questions.
