_Drugs &amp; Wires _is currently on hiatus, but Team D&amp;W is far from idle! With the fall/winter con season now in full gear, we're plugging away at a couple of new print projects that we're hoping to debut at the [London MCM Comic Con](http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london) and [Thought Bubble](http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/). First on the docket: the print version of _Drugs &amp; Wires _Chapter 1. "Clean and Sober Living" collects all 23 pages of the webcomic to date, along with selections of Cryoclaire's concept art and one of our all-time most popular \_D&amp;W _one-shots, ["The Arm"](http://tapastic.com/episode/143666). To tie it all together, Claire's whipped up an all-new, extra-moody coloring job for the title page. That's right: we're talking \_variant cover_. Can't get much more '90s than that.

But if you can't make it to London or Leeds, don't worry - we'll be offering _D&amp;W: Clean and Sober Living _through our online store as soon as we shake off the convention dust, along with any other new print merch we manage to crank out these next few weeks.
