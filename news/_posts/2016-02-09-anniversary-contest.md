### Hey, everyone! Drugs &amp; Wires celebrates its first anniversary on March 22nd, 2016, and we'd like to mark the occasion by saying "thank you" to our awesome readers with not one, but two giveaway contests!

## The LOW EFFORT Giveaway!

Have a Tumblr account and hate putting effort into winning things? We've got just the contest for you, friend! The rules couldn't be simpler: all you have to do is reblog [this post](http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/post/138754428169/its-on-people-told-me-to-do-both-and-so-i-did) and add your favorite _D&amp;W _character(s) in the tags. (This helps us to filter out spammers and giveaway-only blogs!)

### The Prizes

Two rebloggers will be chosen at random on **March 22nd** to receive a copy of _D&amp;W #1 _and a _D&amp;W _postcard!

## The HIGH STAKES Fanart Contest!

It's not secret that we here at _D&amp;W _love [fanart](http://www.drugsandwires.fail/art/), so we're using our anniversary as a shameless excuse to solicit more. The rules run as follows:

-  Draw any character from *D&amp;W*.

-  Keep it PG-13 so we can put it on our website!

-  Post it on social media with the hashtag **#DrugsAndWires** or e-mail it to **cryoclaire(( A T ))gmail.com**.

-  You can enter as many times as you want, but you can't win more than once.

-  Deadline for submissions is **23:59 GMT** on March 23rd.

### The Prizes

**FIRST PLACE:** One original Cryoclaire sketch of your choice, copies of *Drugs &amp; Wires #1* and *Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie*, plus a grab bag of D&amp;W badges, postcards, prints.

**SECOND PLACE (if there's 6+ entries): **One original Cryoclaire sketch of your choice, copies of *Drugs &amp; Wires #1* and *Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie*, plus D&amp;W postcards.

**THIRD PLACE (if there's 6+ entries):** One original Cryoclaire sketch of your choice, *Drugs &amp; Wires #1*, and D&amp;W postcards.

### Thanks for being a part of our first year, and good luck!
