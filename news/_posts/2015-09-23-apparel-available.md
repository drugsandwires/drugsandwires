_(Just in time for our six month anniversary, too.)_

Clothing has always been high up on our personal merch wishlist, so we're happy to announce that we've just dropped our very first set of _Drugs &amp; Wires_ tees, tank tops, and hoodies on [Spreadshirt](http://dnwmerch.spreadshirt.co.uk/). Selection is a little thin at the moment, but we'll be plugging away and adding more designs over time. Fan feedback is also very important to us, so if there's a particular design you'd like to see, don't be shy - hit us up on [social](https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242) [media](http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/)!
