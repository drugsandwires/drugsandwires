The 2015 con season is almost at an end, but we've got one more show to close out the year. Next weekend, Claire will be joining a who's who of comics talent at [Thought Bubble](http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/), the Leeds Comic Art Festival. Going to TB? You can check us out at [table 91](http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/tb-marquee-floor-plan/) in the TB Marquee exhibit area from November 14th to 15th. Due to the limited space (we're restricted to a half table), the merch selection will be a little more selective than at MCM London, but there'll be plenty of copies of both *Drugs and Wires #1* and the new third printing of *Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie!*
