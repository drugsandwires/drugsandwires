Yep, it's that time of year again: fall con season! This week, Cryoclaire will be repping the _D&amp;W _at [London MCM Comic Con](http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/attractions/comic-village/).  From Friday to Sunday, you can swing by booth CK4 at the Comic Village for prints, badges, postcards, on-the-spot sketch commissions, and the all-new print edition of [\_Drugs &amp; Wires: Clear and Sober Living_](http://www.drugsandwires.fail/drugs-wires-issue-1-coming-to-print/).

Having trouble finding the table, or want to set up a meet-and-greet ahead of time? You can always hit Claire up via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242) or [Tumblr](http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/) on the day. See you there!
