Good news - after many months of writing scripts and thumbnails, Blue Pill Arcade is finally getting drawn! First 5 pages are already up on[ Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires).

Blue Pill Arcade is a prequel set 2 years before the events of the main comic. While [Dreamspace ](https://dreamspace.nfshost.com/)(our original prequel series) focuses on Dan's last moments in VR, BPA is all about the early days of Dreamspace and its users. Expect it to be a little more light-hearted than the main series (light-hearted by D&amp;W standards, anyway...)

We'll update the comic  in monthly installments of 6 to 8 pages (depending on Cryo's workload) and keep it as a Patreon exclusive until the story is finished.  Once it's done, we’ll see how to go about publishing it, but it'd most likely be available for purchase online.

Anyway, here's a sneak peak of people's typical reaction to Fixer:
