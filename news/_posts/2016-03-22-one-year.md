Yep, it's true. On March 22nd, 2015, we officially launched this wild, weird little enterprise into the World Wide Web, making this our first official anniversary.

The last 12 months have been a bit of a blur, but in the best way possible: we've published 44 pages of comics, met a lot of talented creators in the process, and - best of all - discovered that there's actually a surprisingly substantial audience for our cyberpunk-flavored brand of post-Soviet misery. So to all our comment section regulars, Tapastic subscribers, and everyone whoâ€™s read, purchased, shared, reviewed our comic, and visited us at conventions... Thank you for making this happen!

We'll be posting the results of our [fanart contest](http://www.drugsandwires.fail/drugs-wires-anniversary-contest/) on the 24th once we've had a chance to go over all of the entries - harder than it sounds, since we've been literally snowed in with great stuff these past couple of weeks! In the meantime, you might also be interested in this little [behind-the-scenes look at the comic's production](http://www.drugsandwires.fail/drugs-wires-anniversary-contest/).
