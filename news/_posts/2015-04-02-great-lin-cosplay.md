Though her knowledge of the human body is shaky at best and her medical ethics went out the window a long time ago, Lin the modder somehow still finds customers willing to drop good money for her services. Casually indifferent to other humans, she's developed a bit of a soft spot for Dan over the years - much as you would for a puppy that can't seem to stop tripping over its own tail.

While we're still a few weeks out from Lin's first official appearance in _Drugs &amp; Wires_, this rendition by reader Nix is almost as good as the real thing (and hopefully, less likely to 'accidentally' leave you with _massively_ illegal enhancements [you never asked for](http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com/post/78051256811/lin-has-a-mild-crush-on-dan-not-in-the-sense-of)).

Even more exciting is the fact that this is our first official fan cosplay -  but hopefully not the last! You can check out [Nix's Tumblr](http://partygirl-nix.tumblr.com/post/114883262280/just-dont-fuck-yourself-up-okay-lin-cosplay) (NSFW) for more pictures of her costume.
