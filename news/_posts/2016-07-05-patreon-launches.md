title: D&W Patreon Launches!
alias: /dw-patreon-launches/
summary: "That's right: it's official. If you follow us on social media, you'll probably know that we've been toying with the idea of setting up a Patreon for quite a while now - all the cool webcomics artists are doing it, so why not us? But we always hit a bit of a hurdle when it came to content: we're not quite in a position where we can offer things like more frequent comic updates, but still want to give people something substantial for their support."

That's right: it's [official](https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires). If you follow us on social media, you'll probably know that we've been toying with the idea of setting up a Patreon for quite a while now - all the cool webcomics artists are doing it, so why not us? But we always hit a _bit_ of a hurdle when it came to content: we're not quite in a position where we can offer things like more frequent comic updates, but still want to give people something substantial for their support.

Over the last couple of weeks, though, we've finally had the time to put together a little grab bag of fan goodies: comics, production art, original script pages, and behind-the-scenes insights. It's a list that'll probably expand a bit in the months ahead; it's important to us that backers get a proper bang-for-buck ratio, and we're kinda figuring out this whole Patreon lark as we go along. So if you've got a suggestion about how we can improve our offerings, let us know! Our metaphorical door is always open.

As for *D&amp;W* itself, you'll be happy to know that our summer hiatus is almost over - in fact, the cover for Chapter 3 is being sketched out as we speak. Watch this space...
