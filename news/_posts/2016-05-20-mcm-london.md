It's that time again: [MCM London Comic Con](http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/) is almost upon us! As in years past, Cryoclaire will be setting up shop in the Comic Village with all the trimmings, including:

-  **Dreamspace: Analogue Edition** - Ever since the initial run of *Dreamspace: Analogue Edition* sold out, we've been peppered with requests for a reprint, so here it is. We took the opportunities to make some tweaks to the story and clean up the continuity a touch; consider this *Analogue Edition 1.01*. Fair warning, though: this'll probably be the last time we make *AE* available to the general public, so get your copy while the going's good.

-  **Drugs &amp; Wires: Issue 2** - Fresh off the presses, it's the entirely of *D.D.F.H.* in future-proof dead-tree format, complete with highly collectible variant cover! (Hey, it's the '90s.)

-  **D&amp;W Temporary Tattoos** - If you follow Cryoclaire on social media, chances are you've [already seen these](https://twitter.com/cryoclaire242/status/733270917741182976), but we're still very, very excited about them.

We'll also be selling *D&amp;W: Issue 1*, the _Daily Struggles of a Cyberjunkie_ one-shot collection, prints, postcards, buttons, and more, more, more. Look for Claire at Table CL2, conveniently located within a stone's throw of the Kids Zone, a decision the organizers may yet regret. (And if you can't make it to London, just watch this space - we'll be updating our store shortly after the event!)
