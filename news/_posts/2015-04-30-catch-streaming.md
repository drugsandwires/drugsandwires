Since nothing boosts your productivity quite like dozens of strangers staring over your e-shoulder, Cryoclaire recently started streaming her penciling and inking sessions on [Picarto.tv](https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel.php?watch=cryoclaire).

If you'd like to take a peek behind the scenes at _D&W_ - or just need an excuse to shoot the breeze about vital, vital topics like Skyler White and the _Leprechaun_ franchise over some bangin' witch house - future streaming dates and times will be announced via Claire's [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cryoclaire242) and [Tumblr](http://cryoclaire.tumblr.com).

**UPDATE: We finally have a schedule of sorts!** Tuesdays and Saturdays. 8pm BST (London time) We're usually on for 3-4 hours. Hope this helps!
