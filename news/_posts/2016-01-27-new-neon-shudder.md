Our buddy Signalrun (AKA Neon Shudder) has had a busy couple of months: following an appropriately spooky (or indeed, spoopy)[ Halloween release](http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/o-8015) and several previews from his first full-length album, he's ringing in 2016 with an all-new EP, entitled [(viii) neuromantic: the communion of nature and technology](http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/viii-neuromantic-the-communion-of-nature-and-technology). This pay-what-you-want release features four tracks of synth-driven atmospherics, including a collaboration with fellow PA-based (x)-wavers Reapers.

Neon Shudder is also a featured artist on the latest [Cyberpunk Community Soundtrack](http://cyberpunkcommunitysoundtrack.tumblr.com/post/137943275310/cyberpunk-community-soundtrack-no5-2015-free), a 100% free compilation of music inspired by everybody's favorite chromed-up sci-fi genre. Happy listening!
