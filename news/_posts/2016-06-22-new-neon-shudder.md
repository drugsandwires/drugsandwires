In other non-comic news, _D&amp;W_ friend/occasional collaborator/unstoppable music factory Neon Shudder released his first full-length LP, [_Cadence_](http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/cadence), on Bandcamp earlier this month. This cyberpunk concept album-slash-multimedia experiment builds on last year's [O​-​8015 EP](http://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/o-8015) with 20 fresh tracks, and includes an illustrated digital novella authored by Mr. Shudder himself.

Longtime followers will discover that *Cadence* marks a big artistic push forward for Yung Shud - a release that doesn't just play with presentation and storytelling, but also offers a broader palette of sounds than previous Neon Shudder EPs.
