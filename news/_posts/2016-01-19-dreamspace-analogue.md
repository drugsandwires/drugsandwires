History time: way back in 2013, Cryoclaire launched _Dreamspace_, an animated, pseudo-interactive story about a down-on-his-luck VR mindtripper named Dan and his (mostly) gradual descent into addiction. In 2014, _Dreamspace _was collected into a print edition with revised dialogue and some additional material, appropriately called _Dreamspace: Analogue Edition_. Last year, the first print run of _Analogue Edition _officially sold out, and we started planning an expanded second edition to replace it. As of January 2016, we're... still in the planning stages, to be honest, so while _Analogue Edition 2.0 _sits in creative limbo, we thought we'd at least make the original available online.

Like all things *D&amp;W*, you can access (and subscribe to!) the suddenly less appropriately titled _DS: Analogue Edition _through [Cryoclaire's Tapastic page](http://tapastic.com/cryoclaire).
