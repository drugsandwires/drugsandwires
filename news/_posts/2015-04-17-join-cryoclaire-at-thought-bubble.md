If you're a UK resident and serious about comics, Leeds' Thought Bubble Festival is a fantastic place to meet some of the most talented creators in the field. \_(Seriously, just look at [this lineup](http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/guests/).) So naturally, we're all kinds of hyped that we made the cut for the 2015 [Thought Bubble Convention](http://thoughtbubblefestival.com/exhibitors/), which takes place alongside the Festival on November 14th and 15th.

Cryoclaire will be spreading the *D&amp;W* gospel to the unsuspecting masses (and hopefully offering some neat new merch to boot), so if you're making the trip to Thought Bubble this year, stop on by and say 'hi!'
