Composer [Neon Shudder](https://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/) has been a long-time fixture in Dan and Lin’s messed-up world, having contributed backing tracks to both the second and third installments of _[Dreamspace](http://dreamspace.nfshost.com/)_. His latest EP, _Hex Phase_, is now available for streaming and pay-what-you-want download on Bandcamp, and features some pixel-tastic cover art from our very own Cryoclaire! If you’re in the mood for some old-school, synth-driven ambience with a distinct cyberpunk flavor, definitely [give *Hex Phase* a spin](https://neonshudder.bandcamp.com/album/hex-phase).
