Yes, we did go on a random hiatus _checks notes_ 1 page before ending the chapter. Sorry about that! Between my move to Sweden, Io being busy with Life Stuff and us working on [Dates & Wires](https://twitter.com/MarySafroArt/status/1371871428899966978), the D&W otome game that comes out on Monday, our schedule kind of went off the rails. Hopefully things will settle down soon so we can start rebuilding our buffer and give chapter 8 the start it deserves.
Thanks so much for reading and commenting, it really means a lot! <3 -Cryo
