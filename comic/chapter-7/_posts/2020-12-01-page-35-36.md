Well, as Lin's first rally ends, so do our updates for 2020! We're taking the rest of the month off to work on our buffer - our patrons will see the pages go up as we work on them. Thanks so much for reading - I feel like despite the dumpster fire this year's been, our comic finally got back on track. It's been fun to work on, and hopefully, fun to read, despite an occasional soul-crushing moment here and there :)

See you all in 2021!
