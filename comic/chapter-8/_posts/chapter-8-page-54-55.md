You know I'm hijacking the comic when plot takes a break so I can draw my ship for a few pages. 

And with that we've just wrapped up chapter 8! It ran for almost one year exactly with minimal interruptions and I can only hope that I'll be able to dedicate as much time to it in the future.

 If you want to help Drugs & Wires stay afloat and get some bonus content, our [Patreon ](https://www.patreon.com/drugsandwires)is gonna have some chapter 9 development and pages coming out shortly. Hoping to finally build that buffer for real before I start putting the pages up on the site again.

I'm also working on a kickstarter campaign for Volume 2 which should launch Late July/Early August! Will definitely post an announcement on here and our social media so keep an eye out :)

As always, we're happy to hear your thoughts here or on our[ Discord](https://discord.gg/xRK67a6jmC) server.

Anyway, here's Dan turning his life around:
