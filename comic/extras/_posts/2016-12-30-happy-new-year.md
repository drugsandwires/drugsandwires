New Year is a much bigger thing in Russia than Christmas, so it was only fair to make a NY special inspired by Russian festive postcards. Hoping to finish some NY-themed strips for the Patreon folk too, but as I'm currently back in Latvia and struggling with my portable equipment (making this was quite an adventure), that might have to wait.

Anyway, this year's been tough for a lot of us, so here's to 2017 being a little less disastrous so we can keep inflicting misery on D&amp;W cast instead. To all of you who's been reading, commenting, sharing, buying our merch and supporting us on Patreon, I can't express how grateful we are! Thank you for keeping us going and making D&amp;W happen. Special thanks to all of our Twitch stream regulars who's been turning up week after week to make sure I get some work done. You people got me through some tough times and I can only hope we'll keep doing this in 2017.  Happy New Year!  -Cryo
