Dates & Wires, the first official D&W visual novel is [now available on itch.io!](https://ioblack.itch.io/dates-and-wires)

It's a dreary night in Unylsk and you're a horrible trash tourist desperate to make some terrible life choices. One night, six dates, many endings some of which might even be good.

Originally planned as an April Fool's joke, the game quickly outgrew its original scope and took almost 4 months to make, but here it is, featuring some cool new lore even for folks familiar with the comic.

Big thanks to NINGEN for providing the music and our patrons and playstesters.
