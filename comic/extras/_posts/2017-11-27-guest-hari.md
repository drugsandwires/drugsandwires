Hey folks! While we're currently on a break, we've got a few weeks of beautiful guest art coming up. Do check out their amazing work elsewhere and show them some love here and on social media!

This week we're bringing you some delightfully spooky gif work by Hari! Hari is an award-winning comics artist and professional illustrator / big nerd, who just finished up a 200+ page fantasy comic with a lot of [videogame jokes](http://bit.ly/NyxComics) and is working on a new comic about magic, forests and people having [feelings](http://bit.ly/FHcomic).

Hari's on Twitter &amp; Instagram [@haridraws](https://twitter.com/haridraws), and just wants Dan to be okay.
