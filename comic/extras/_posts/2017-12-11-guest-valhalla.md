This week's beautiful guest art is another animated GIF! Our last chapter's obviously lacked in the Dan Tripping Out department, so I'm glad we can still get our fix thanks to our guest artists!
Valhalla Halvorson is an Illinois based illustrator/designer who also makes a webcomic called [Maluk](http://maluk.webcomic.ws/) (also available on [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/Maluk)), a depressing noir story about a man and his daughter.
