Appropriately enough, today's guest piece hails from an artist whose comic actually _launched_ in 1995!

[Laura Watton](http://www.PinkAppleJam.com) is a UK comicker heavily influenced by '80s and '90s Japanese pop culture and comics, and goes by the name PinkAppleJam online. Laura's long-running 3-book comic series [_Biomecha_](http://www.BiomechaComic.com) is a sci-fi drama about growing up in a near-future world of imperfect cybernetics in a school/college scenario. The characters handle powers and problems of biomechanics, PSI powers, integrated future tech... as well as the paranoia and questions that come with all of that. Book 3 of the series is currently underway [via Patreon](http://www.Patreon.com/PinkAppleJam).
