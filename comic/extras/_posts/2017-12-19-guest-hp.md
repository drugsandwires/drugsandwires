Today's guest art is brought to you by H-P and I was stunned by the detail in the piece! I also loved that H-P based it on an existing ad - perhaps some of you might recognise the original?

H-P Lehkonen is a Finnish comics artist specializing in queer comics. He's currently working on his new webcomic, [Life Outside the Circle](http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/life-outside-the-circle/list?title_no=1260).

His previous webcomic, which finished this August, was a sci-fi humor story called [Immortal Nerd](http://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/immortal-nerd/list?title_no=579). Apart from drawing comics, he also lectures about how to make money with them!
