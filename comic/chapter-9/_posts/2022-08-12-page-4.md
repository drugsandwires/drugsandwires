We're gonna be going on another hiatus - sorry, everyone! It wasn't planned, but life happens and you can read more on why in my [public Patreon post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/70416171?pr=true)

I will still update patrons if I manage to get pages out in upcoming weeks but there won't be a real schedule until things have settled and I have some sort of routine again. Thank you all for your patience :)
