             - "A med school reject who now makes her living installing illegal bodymods and providing medical care to the dregs of society. Lin loves cybernetics, but is somewhat less interested in the people they’re attached to. As a result, her methods of working aren’t particularly gentle."
             - "Lin befriended Dan while he was still using VR, and saved his brain from being completely fried by the worm."

             - "AKA Cybernator. One of the sharpest (and cockiest) operators on the scene, which is no mean feat when you haven’t even hit legal drinking age yet. Thanks to indulgent parents and the wonders of mail order, Nate is neck-deep in the latest, shiniest tech, some of which might even work as advertised."
             - "Despite going together about as well as nails and a chalkboard, Nate and Dan have teamed up on a number of VR contracts over the years. That partnership ended on something of a sour note after their last job left Dan with a nasty worm problem."

             - Better known (and disdained) in Dreamspace circles by his operator handle, 666_Satan_666, Vlad Adsky is a natural-born opportunist. He often claims to be responsible for introducing Satanism to Unylsk, though strangely enough, most of the city’s actual Satanists want nothing to do with him.
             - Beyond acting as managing editor and figurehead of prominent scene ‘zine Fear_and_Loading, Vlad fancies himself as a Byronic poet, philosopher, and general renaissance man. Unfortunately, none of these pursuits have been terribly profitable for him; his long-suffering girlfriend, Tasha, is the one stuck paying rent and utilities.

             - "Every once in a blue moon, Legit Deliveries would have to truck out a shipment beyond the relative safety of Unylsk’s city walls to the toxic countryside up north. That’s when they called Nagy, the only Legit employee willing to risk life and limb out in the “Dregs” – at least until he got banged up on multiple charges of dognapping. A prison stint doesn’t seem to have done anything for his attitude towards other people’s personal property, but at least farmers are getting their packages again."

             - Synacon’s Director of Sales is a relatively recent addition to the company. Depending on who you ask, he’s either a take-no-prisoners dealmaker who believes in working hard and playing harder, or a slithering opportunist who only jumped ship to virtual reality to escape the impending bankruptcy of his supercar dealership.
